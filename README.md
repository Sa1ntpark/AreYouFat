# Project Explanation

This site can get you know how fat you are. It's hard to know exactly how fat Iam with the BMI figures. In addition, body composition analyzer(so-called INBODY) is too expensive and can be cumbersome to go where it is. So our team wanted to solve this problem. This site was created as a result.
